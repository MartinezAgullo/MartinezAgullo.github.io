My personal webpage. See the result [here](https://martinezagullo.github.io/).

A Jekyll theme based on [Uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) and the [Uno Timeline](https://github.com/tzuehlke/jekyll-uno-timeline). 
I added a web-based CV.

Run with 

bundle exec jekyll serve --watch


## Details/Features/Changes
Based on [Uno Timeline Theme](https://github.com/tzuehlke/jekyll-uno-timeline) but:
  * Added a web-based CV:
    * Information organised in tabs
    * Responsive
    * Languge skills as bars
  * Codes can be classified by type
  * The animation is messed up and now it only works properly the first time on each refresh





> :warning:
  This theme requires ruby and rubygems installed
