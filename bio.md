Hello there! <br>
I’m Pablo, a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Valencia and the Instituto de Física Corpuscular (IFIC). My research was conducted for the ATLAS experiment at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), where I focused on analysing vast volumes of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to better understand the physics of the top quark and the Higgs boson. I place a strong emphasis on software development tailored for data analysis. Over the years, I have developed substantial expertise in creating machine learning solutions that enhance data interpretation and research outcomes.
