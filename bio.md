Hello there! <br>
I'm Pablo, a PhD in Physics from the University of Valencia and the Instituto de FÃ­sica Corpuscular (IFIC). My research was conducted for the ATLAS experiment at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), where I focused on analyzing the vast volumes of data from from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to better understand the physics of the top quark and the Higgs boson. I have a strong emphasis on software development tailored for data analysis and have developed substantial expertise in creating machine learning solutions to enhance data interpretation and research outcomes.
