Hello there!<br>
I’m Pablo, a PhD in Physics from the University of Valencia and the Instituto de Física Corpuscular (IFIC). My research was conducted as part of the ATLAS experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), where I specialized in analyzing vast volumes of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). My work primarily focused on uncovering the physics of the top quark and the Higgs boson.

With a strong focus on applying Machine Learning and artificial intelligence to complex datasets, I have developed a specialized skill set that has driven innovation in scientific analytics. This expertise has fostered significant collaborations with leading universities and research institutions across Europe, enhancing the data interpretation and pushing the boundaries of our understanding in fundamental physics. While my experience is centered around CERN data, I am enthusiastic about applying my knowledge and skills to new challenges in various fields.

Currently, I am looking forward to new challenges where I can apply my skills in AI, machine learning, and data science to tackle complex problems, whether in academia, industry, or beyond.

Hello there! <br>
I’m Pablo, a PhD in Physics from the University of Valencia and the Instituto de Física Corpuscular (IFIC). My research was conducted for the ATLAS experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), where I focused on analysing vast volumes of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to better understand the physics of the top quark and the Higgs boson. I place a strong emphasis on software development tailored for data analysis. Over the years, I have developed substantial expertise in creating machine learning solutions that enhance data interpretation and research outcomes.
